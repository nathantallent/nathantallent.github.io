	abstract = {A critical performance challenge in distributed scientific workflows is coordinating tasks and data flows on distributed resources. To guide these decisions, this paper introduces data flow lifecycle analysis. Workflows are commonly represented using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Data flow lifecycles (DFL) enrich task DAGs with data objects and properties that describe data flow and how tasks interact with that flow. Lifecycles enable analysis from several important perspectives: task, data, and data flow. We describe representation, measurement, analysis, visualization, and opportunity identification for DFLs. Our measurement is both distributed and scalable, using space that is constant per data file. We use lifecycles and opportunity analysis to reason about improved task placement and reduced data movement for five scientific workflows with different characteristics. Case studies show improvements of 15\texttimes{}, 1.9\texttimes{}, and 10--30\texttimes{}. Our work is implemented in the DataLife tool.},

To guide these decisions, this paper introduces data flow lifecycle analysis. Workflows are commonly represented using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Data flow lifecycles (DFL) enrich task DAGs with data objects and properties that describe data flow and how tasks interact with that flow. Lifecycles enable analysis from several important perspectives: task, data, and data flow. We describe representation, measurement, analysis, visualization, and opportunity identification for DFLs. Our measurement is both distributed and scalable, using space that is constant per data file. We use lifecycles and opportunity analysis to reason about improved task placement and reduced data movement for five scientific workflows with different characteristics. Case studies show improvements of 15\texttimes{}, 1.9\texttimes{}, and 10--30\texttimes{}. Our work is implemented in the DataLife tool.},

	abstract = {Power efficiency - performance relative to power - is one of the most important concerns when designing RADAR processing systems. This paper analyzes power and performance trade-offs for a typical Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) application. We study STAP implementations for CUDA and OpenMP on two architectures, Intel Haswell Core I7-4770TE and NVIDIA Kayla with a GK208 GPU. We analyze the power and performance of STAP's computationally intensive kernels across the two hardware testbeds. We discuss an efficient parallel implementation for the Haswell CPU architecture. We also show the impact and trade-offs of GPU optimization techniques. The GPU architecture is able to process large size data sets without increase in power requirement. The use of shared memory has a significant impact on the power requirement for the GPU. Finally, we show that a balance between the use of shared memory and main memory access leads to an improved performance in a typical STAP application.},

Recently, new capabilities were added to HPCTOOLKIT for collecting call path profiles for fully optimized codes without any compiler support, pinpointing and quantifying bottlenecks in multithreaded programs, exploring performance information and source code using a new user interface, and displaying hierarchical space-time diagrams based on traces of asynchronous call path samples. This paper provides an overview of HPCTOOLKIT and illustrates its utility for performance analysis of parallel applications.},
